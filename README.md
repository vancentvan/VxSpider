	 storage(save and classify);
	 
	2. Translate to English from pinyin(Chinese);
	
	3. Practice*: Build ML models(AlexNet, VGG) to train on these images and keep tuning to improve accuracy.

Things needs to be clarified:

	1. Common resources and resource types displayed in a normal HTML page;
		visit https://leohxj.gitbooks.io/front-end-database/html-and-css-basic/common-tag.html
	2. How to classify and category webpage;
